I'm using Selenium Webdriver for Chrome to automate tests cases for Hotel Booking Application adactinhotelapp.com

For writing tast cases I'm using Cucumber & Gherkin, creating the .feature files which are stored in /src/test/java/stepdefs/
The code that runs Cucumber text is written in Java with Selenium Webdriver. The files are located in /src/test/resources folder that is glued to /src/test/java/stepdefs/
