I'm using Selenium Webdriver for Chrome and JUnit and the given requiremnt data develop automate tests cases in a Hotel Booking Application, a learning platform for Software Testing - adactinhotelapp.com.
For writing tast cases I'm using BDD approach in Cucumber & Gherkin. The created .feature files are stored in /src/test/java/stepdefs/
The code that runs Cucumber text is written in Java with Selenium Webdriver with JUnit. The files are located in /src/test/resources folder that is glued to /src/test/java/stepdefs/
