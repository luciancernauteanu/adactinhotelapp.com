I'm using Selenium Webdriver for Chrome to automate tests cases for Hotel Booking Application adactinhotelapp.com with requiremnt data given.
For writing tast cases I'm using Cucumber & Gherkin. The created .feature files are stored in /src/test/java/stepdefs/
The code that runs Cucumber text is written in Java with Selenium Webdriver. The files are located in /src/test/resources folder that is glued to /src/test/java/stepdefs/
